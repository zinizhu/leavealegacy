          There’s no doubt about it: Lakers has the most glorious history among
          all NBA teams. Just take a look at all the retired jersey hanging in
          Staples Center: Elgin Baylor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson,
          James Worthy, Jerry West, Shaquille O’Neal, Kobe Bryant. Needless to
          say the 16 O’brien tropies it owns. With such glory, this team’s goal
          has never changed: the championship.

          <p>
            The Lakers’ trajectory was completely changed starting from 2013, when their superstar Kobe Bryant went down with a torn Achilles. 
            They quickly fell from a championship competitor to a lottery team.

          <div class="text-box" id="misery-step-1">
            The <span class="highlight-keywords">torn Achilles</span> was the start of the nightmare. Shortly after coming back from the injury, Kobe was out again due to <span class="highlight-keywords">knee</span> and <span class="highlight-keywords">shoulder injuries</span>. In 2016, the legendary player announced his retirement.

          <div class="text-box" id="misery-step-2">
            Lakers tried to bring some fresh blood to the team.

          Anthony Davis came. In order to get the 6-year All-star player, Lakers
          sent Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and 3 first-round picks to
          New Orleans Pelicans. The price was high, but Lakers finally got the
          last piece towards the championship. Meanwhile, AD’s move to LA put
          him in a major market. He also had the chance to play deep in the
          playoffs for the first time in his career.

      <div>
        <p>
          Due to the Covid-19 plague, the Lakers only played 71 games in this
          regular season, and with the 52-19 records, the Lakers ranked 1st in
          the West Conference. Lebron and Anthony Davis found the way to play
          with momentum and make the Lakers one of the greatest teams in the
          league. Frank Vogel’s arrival made the Lakers a strong defensive team.
          The team ranked 4 in PTS allow and 2nd in REB allow. They get the 2nd
          most defensive rebounds and gave the most blocks per game. Their
          offensive rankings are not as good, though. Lakers’ cursed 3-pt
          shooting still didn’t get much better this year, even they signed a
          few good shooters. Their 3PT% was ranked 21th and their FT% was ranked
          29th - which could be a big issue in the playoffs.

              After losing DeMarcus Cousins to an ACL injury before him ever
              suiting up for the purple and gold, the Lakers signed Howard with
              a one-year, non-guaranteed, ‘prove it’ deal that the big man
              himself asked for.Due to the last unhappy experience Howard had
              with the team, Laker fans were still skeptical as to what kind of
              impact he would have for the team. Those prejudices were quickly
              squashed after only the third game of the season against the
              Charlotte Hornets, as the former All-Star played a perfect game,
              going 8/8 from the field, scoring 16pts with 19 rebounds, in only
              22 minutes of play.

              Los Angeles Lakers big man Anthony Davis now has something in
              common with a short list of all-time franchise greats. The Brow
              went off for a huge 40 points and 20 rebound game against the
              Memphis Grizzlies, in just 30 minutes. In the game, Davis went
              26-27 from the foul line, breaking the franchise record for free
              throws made in a single game, which was previously held by Dwight
              Howard. Meanwhile, the Grizzlies just attempted 23 free throws as
              a team in last night’s game.

              It didn’t take long for the 2-times champion guard to prove
              himself. In only the fifth game of the season, the Lakers were in
              a close game against Luka Donic and the Dallas Mavericks, with the
              team down three with 6.4 seconds left on the clock. As James drove
              to the basket, he lasered a pass to a semi-open Danny Green in the
              corner, who calmly pump-faked a scrambling Seth Curry and nailed
              the game-tying 3-pointer to send the game into overtime.

              Davis went off for a season-high 50 points, en route to a monster
              stat line of 50/7/6, with four blocks and one steal. The Brow was
              unconscious from every spot on the floor and showed us the full
              range of his skills as a scorer. He led the Los Angeles Lakers to
              a huge blowout victory against the Timberwolves 142-125 and
              elevated the team’s record to 21-3. This is the game where we were

              pairing as these two were fully in their bags.

              James passed Kobe Bryant for the third on the all-time scoring

              that coveted third spot on the all-time scoring list with

              Staples Center crowd, culminating in a deafening cheer after the
              fifth and final 3-pointer from James. LeBron finished the game
              with 36 points, 7 rebounds, and 9 assists and went 6-9 from the

              two other teams who many have pegged as favorites to hoist the
              Larry O’Brien trophy.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the game against the Milwaukee Bucks, who had the best record
              in the league, and the reigning MVP in Giannis Antetokounmpo,
              the Lakers were firmly in the driver’s seat for the entirety of
              the game, and a late-game spin-move into a thunderous jam by
              LeBron James put the game on ice for good. LeBron ended up with a
              cool 37/8/8, and Anthony Davis chipped in with 30 points and 9
              rebounds on the way to a convincing 113-103 victory.
              <br />
              <br />
              The next challenge would be the Los Angeles Clippers. After losses
              against the Clippers on opening night and Christmas day, the team
              was eager to prove their status as a true championship contender,
              and they did just that in their third matchup of the season. This
              was a hard-fought, back and forth game from the opening tip, and
              was one of the few games of the season that truly had a playoff
              atmosphere. LeBron James made a 3-point play with 40 seconds left
              to put the game away for good. The team also got important
              contributions from the role players. These two victories were huge
              for the Lakers as the team was just starting to click heading into
              the playoffs. They convincingly beat two teams who were considered
              heavy favorites to win the championship, and the team’s chemistry
              was at an all-time high.

          Lakers advantage in defense can also been read from this graph. There
          are five players getting more thant 5 rebounds and five players
          getting more than 1.0 steals per game. The high number of turnovers
          per game is kind of relavant to their play strategies, but still they
          need to figure out ways to improve it.

          the main defensive play in the team, decided not to play when the
          season resumed, and Lakers got 3-5 records in the remaining 8 games.
          <br /><br />
          The playoffs opening game against Portland was a disaster. Lakers let
          Damian Lillard scored 34 points. Their shooring percentage was just
          35.1% for field goals and 15.6% for three-pointers. But then Lakers
          got back on they feet and won four straight to move to the
          semi-finals. Similar stories happened again. Lakers lost to the
          Rockets in Game1, then turned up their intensity of defense and had
          another 4-game winning streak.
          <br /><br />
          This year's playoffs was full of surprise. Nikola Jokic and Jamal
          Murray led the Nuggests to eliminate the Clippers, and Miami Heat
          defeated the Bucks and Celtics to become the winner in the East
          Conference. This time, Lakers didn’t give them the chance and beat the
          two teams in 5 and 6 games.

          Playoffs is where the all-star players begin to show their values.
          Lebron James and Anthony Davis are this team's absolute leaders. The
          small multiples compare their general stats in regular season and the
          playoffs. The bar charts and lines show their shooting performance at
          different distances and in different quarters.

          No more drama. With a dominant final flourish, the Los Angeles
          Lakers won it all for the first time in a decade. LeBron James logged
          a triple-double -- 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists -- to win his
          fourth Finals MVP award and fourth ring. For AD, he won his first
          ring. The Lakers became the first team in league history to go
          undefeated when taking a lead into the fourth quarter, going 57-0
          between the regular season and the playoffs. They were also the first
          franchise to earn the No. 1 seed following a five-year postseason
          absence.
          <br />
          <br />
          The franchise did it. And they will do it again next year.
