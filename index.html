          The Los Angeles Lakers have the most glorious history among all the teams in the 
          National Basketball Association. One only needs to look at all the retired jerseys 
          hanging in the Staples Center: Elgin Baylor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, 
          James Worthy, Jerry West, Shaquille O’Neal, and Kobe Bryant. Additionally, they have 
          won 16 Championships. With such a rich history, the goal for the Lakers is always 
          the same - Win a Championship!

          <h3>Time of Misery</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            The Lakers’ trajectory was completely changed in 2013, when their
            superstar Kobe Bryant went down with a torn Achilles. They quickly
            fell from a championship contender to a lottery team.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="misery-text">
          <div class="text-box" id="misery-step-1">
            The <span class="highlight-keywords">torn Achilles</span> was the
            start of the nightmare. Shortly after coming back from the injury,
            Kobe was out again due to
            <span class="highlight-keywords">knee</span> and
            <span class="highlight-keywords">shoulder injuries</span>. In 2016,
            the legendary player would announce his retirement from the NBA.
          </div>
          <div class="text-box" id="misery-step-2">
            Lakers tried to bring some fresh talent to the team through their draft
            picks. They used their
            top picks to select
            <span class="highlight-keywords">Julius Randle ('15)</span>,
            <span class="highlight-keywords">D’Angelo Russell ('16)</span>,

          <div class="text-box" id="misery-step-3">
            However, things didn’t get better. Lakers were not able to get into

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            After struggling for 7 years, the team finally started moving in the
            right direction. In 2018, they signed LeBron James in 2018 followed 
            by Anthony Davis in 2019. The Lakers traded their young players to assemble
            a new team around the two superstars.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Most of the new players in the team were players with a proven track
            records, but with something to prove. There was still doubt and dispute. 
            ESPN ranked Lakers only 4th in their list of possible contenders, with
            a significant majority of experts believing that LeBron would get 0 titles in the next
            4 years with the Lakers.

            go and to get his respect back.

      <div>
        <p>
          Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Lakers only played 71 games in this
          regular season. With a 52-19 record, Lakers ranked 1st in the Western
          Conference. The team ranked 4th in points allowed and 2nd in rebounds allowed. They
          ranked 2nd for defensive rebounds and set the most blocks per game.
          Their offensive ranking was not as good, though. Lakers’ 3-pt
          shooting didn’t get significantly better this year even with KCP and Danny Green.
          They ranked 21th for the field goal percentage for three points 
          and 29th for free throw percentage. These liabilities could be a big issue in the playoffs.

                After losing DeMarcus Cousins to an ACL injury before him ever
                suiting up for the purple and gold, the Lakers signed Howard
                with a one-year, non-guaranteed, ‘prove it’ deal that the big
                man himself asked for. Due to the last unhappy experience Howard
                had with the team, Lakers fans were still skeptical as to what
                kind of impact he would have for the team. Those prejudices were
                quickly squashed after only the third game of the season against
                the Charlotte Hornets, as the former All-Star played a perfect
                game, going 8/8 from the field, scoring 16 pts with 19 rebounds,
                in only 22 minutes of play.

              went off for a huge 40 points and 20 rebounds game against the
              Memphis Grizzlies, in <i>just</i> 30 minutes. In the game, Davis went

              a close game against Luka Donic and the Dallas Mavericks, with the
              team down three with 6.4 seconds left on the clock. As James drove
              to the basket, he lasered a pass to a semi-open Danny Green in the
              corner, who calmly pump-faked a scrambling Seth Curry and nailed
              the game-tying 3-pointer to send the game into overtime.

              These two games were projected to be one of the toughest parts of
              the Lakers’ schedule. Both the teams were pegged to be favorites to 
              win the championship.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the game against the Milwaukee Bucks led by the reigning MVP
              Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Lakers were in control right from the 
              beginning of the game, and a late-game spin-move into a
              thunderous jam by LeBron James was the resounding exclamation to
              mark the end of the game.
              LeBron ended up with an impressive 37/8/8 and AD contributed with 30
              points and 9 rebounds.
              <br />
              <br />
              After losses against the Clippers on opening night and Christmas
              day, the team was eager to prove their status as a true
              championship contender. LeBron James made a 3-point play with 40
              seconds to go that ended up being a decisive play to win the game.

            The regular season was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. When
            the season resumed, doubts rose on whether the Lakers could play at the same
            high level during the playoffs, considering the team's high average
            age.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            Avery Bradley, who was the main defensive player in the team,
            decided not to play. In addition, the whole series would be carried
            out in “the Bubble”.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            Apart from the competitions, the team would also have to overcome
            other kinds of obstacles, such as being separated from their 
            families for over three months.
