          There’s no doubt about it: Lakers has the most glorious history among
          all NBA teams. Just take a look at all the retired jersey hanging in
          Staples Center: Elgin Baylor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson,
          James Worthy, Jerry West, Shaquille O’Neal, Kobe Bryant. Needless to
          say the 16 O’brien tropies it owns. With such glory, this team’s goal
          has never changed: the championship.

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            The Lakers’ trajectory was completely changed starting from 2013,
            when their superstar Kobe Bryant went down with a torn Achilles.
            They quickly fell from a championship competitor to a lottery team.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="misery-text">
          <div class="text-box" id="misery-step-1">
            The <span class="highlight-keywords">torn Achilles</span> was the
            start of the nightmare. Shortly after coming back from the injury,
            Kobe was out again due to
            <span class="highlight-keywords">knee</span> and
            <span class="highlight-keywords">shoulder injuries</span>. In 2016,
            the legendary player announced his retirement.

          <div class="text-box" id="misery-step-2">
            Lakers tried to bring some fresh blood to the team. They used their

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            After struggling for 7 years, the team finally moved towards the
            right direction. They signed LeBron James in 2018, which was a good
            start. In 2019, Lakers sent away their young players to get Anthony
            Davis and built a new team around the two superstars.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Most of the new players in the team were players with proven track
            records. However, there were also dispute and doubt. In the ESPN
            prediction, Lakers was ranked only 4th towards the champion, with
            >50% the experts believing that LeBron would get 0 title in the next
            4 years.

      <div>
        <p>
          Due to the Covid-19 plague, the Lakers only played 71 games in this
          regular season, and with the 52-19 records, the Lakers ranked 1st in
          the West Conference. Lebron and Anthony Davis found the way to play
          with momentum and make the Lakers one of the greatest teams in the
          league. Frank Vogel’s arrival made the Lakers a strong defensive team.
          The team ranked 4 in PTS allow and 2nd in REB allow. They get the 2nd
          most defensive rebounds and gave the most blocks per game. Their
          offensive rankings are not as good, though. Lakers’ cursed 3-pt
          shooting still didn’t get much better this year, even they signed a
          few good shooters. Their 3PT% was ranked 21th and their FT% was ranked
          29th - which could be a big issue in the playoffs.

                After losing DeMarcus Cousins to an ACL injury before him ever
                suiting up for the purple and gold, the Lakers signed Howard
                with a one-year, non-guaranteed, ‘prove it’ deal that the big
                man himself asked for.Due to the last unhappy experience Howard
                had with the team, Laker fans were still skeptical as to what
                kind of impact he would have for the team. Those prejudices were
                quickly squashed after only the third game of the season against
                the Charlotte Hornets, as the former All-Star played a perfect
                game, going 8/8 from the field, scoring 16pts with 19 rebounds,
                in only 22 minutes of play.

              Los Angeles Lakers big man Anthony Davis now has something in
              common with a short list of all-time franchise greats. The Brow
              went off for a huge 40 points and 20 rebound game against the
              Memphis Grizzlies, in just 30 minutes. In the game, Davis went
              26-27 from the foul line, breaking the franchise record for free
              throws made in a single game, which was previously held by Dwight
              Howard. Meanwhile, the Grizzlies just attempted 23 free throws as
              a team in last night’s game.

              It didn’t take long for the 2-times champion guard to prove
              himself. In only the fifth game of the season, the Lakers were in
              a close game against Luka Donic and the Dallas Mavericks, with the
              team down three with 6.4 seconds left on the clock. As James drove
              to the basket, he lasered a pass to a semi-open Danny Green in the
              corner, who calmly pump-faked a scrambling Seth Curry and nailed
              the game-tying 3-pointer to send the game into overtime.

              Davis went off for a season-high 50 points, en route to a monster
              stat line of 50/7/6, with four blocks and one steal. The Brow was
              unconscious from every spot on the floor and showed us the full
              range of his skills as a scorer. He led the Los Angeles Lakers to
              a huge blowout victory against the Timberwolves 142-125 and
              elevated the team’s record to 21-3. This is the game where we were
              able to see the full potential of a LeBron James/Anthony Davis
              pairing as these two were fully in their bags.

              James passed Kobe Bryant for the third on the all-time scoring
              list. This is a moment that will, unfortunately, be forever
              intertwined with the tragic passing of one of basketball’s most
              legendary players, but that still shouldn’t take away from the
              importance of this monumental moment in sports. Kobe Bryant earned
              that coveted third spot on the all-time scoring list with

              These two games were projected to be one of the toughest parts of

              two other teams who many have pegged as favorites to hoist the
              Larry O’Brien trophy.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the game against the Milwaukee Bucks led by the reigning MVP
              Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Lakers were firmly in the driver’s seat
              for the entirety of the game, and a late-game spin-move into a
              thunderous jam by LeBron James put the game on ice for good.
              LeBron ended up with a cool 37/8/8, and AD chipped in with 30
              points and 9 rebounds.
              <br />
              <br />
              After losses against the Clippers on opening night and Christmas
              day, the team was eager to prove their status as a true
              championship contender. LeBron James made a 3-point play with 40
              seconds left to put the game away for good. The team’s chemistry
              was at an all-time high.
