          The Los Angeles Lakers have the most glorious history among all the teams in the 
          National Basketball Association. One only needs to look at all the retired jerseys 
          hanging in the Staples Center: Elgin Baylor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, 
          James Worthy, Jerry West, Shaquille O’Neal, and Kobe Bryant. Additionally, they have 
          won 16 Championships. With such a rich history, the goal for the Lakers is always 
          the same - Win a Championship!

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            The Lakers’ trajectory was completely changed in 2013, when their
            superstar Kobe Bryant went down with a torn Achilles. They quickly
            fell from a championship competitor to a lottery team.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="misery-text">
          <div class="text-box" id="misery-step-1">
            The <span class="highlight-keywords">torn Achilles</span> was the
            start of the nightmare. Shortly after coming back from the injury,
            Kobe was out again due to
            <span class="highlight-keywords">knee</span> and
            <span class="highlight-keywords">shoulder injuries</span>. In 2016,
            the legendary player announced his retirement.

          <div class="text-box" id="misery-step-2">
            Lakers tried to bring some fresh blood to the team. They used their

            <span class="highlight-keywords">D’Angelo Russell</span>,

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            After struggling for 7 years, the team finally moved towards the
            right direction. They signed LeBron James in 2018, which was a good
            start. In 2019, Lakers sent away their young players to get Anthony
            Davis and built a new team around the two superstars.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Most of the new players in the team were players with proven track
            records. However, there were also dispute and doubt. In the ESPN
            prediction, Lakers was ranked only 4th towards the champion, with
            >50% the experts believing that LeBron would get 0 title in the next
            4 years.

            experience on defense was also fatal. He had to prove that he was
            the right choice.

          Due to the Covid-19 plague, the Lakers only played 71 games in this
          regular season. With a 52-19 records, Lakers ranked 1st in the West
          Conference. The team ranked 4 in PTS allow and 2nd in REB allow. They
          ranked 2nd for defensive rebounds and sent the most blocks per game.
          Their offensive rankings were not as good, though. Lakers’ cursed 3-pt
          shooting didn’t get much better this year, with 3FG% ranked 21th and
          FT% ranked 29th - which could be a big issue in the playoffs.

                After losing DeMarcus Cousins to an ACL injury before him ever
                suiting up for the purple and gold, the Lakers signed Howard
                with a one-year, non-guaranteed, ‘prove it’ deal that the big
                man himself asked for.Due to the last unhappy experience Howard
                had with the team, Laker fans were still skeptical as to what
                kind of impact he would have for the team. Those prejudices were
                quickly squashed after only the third game of the season against
                the Charlotte Hornets, as the former All-Star played a perfect
                game, going 8/8 from the field, scoring 16pts with 19 rebounds,
                in only 22 minutes of play.

              went off for a huge 40 points and 20 rebound game against the
              Memphis Grizzlies, in just 30 minutes. In the game, Davis went
              26-27 from the foul line, breaking the franchise record for free
              throws made in a single game, which was previously held by Dwight
              Howard. Meanwhile, the Grizzlies just attempted 23 free throws as
              a team in last night’s game.

              a close game against Luka Donic and the Dallas Mavericks, with the
              team down three with 6.4 seconds left on the clock. As James drove
              to the basket, he lasered a pass to a semi-open Danny Green in the
              corner, who calmly pump-faked a scrambling Seth Curry and nailed
              the game-tying 3-pointer to send the game into overtime.

              a huge blowout victory against the Timberwolves 142-125 and

              James passed Kobe Bryant for the third on the all-time scoring
              list. This is a moment that will, unfortunately, be forever
              intertwined with the tragic passing of one of basketball’s most
              legendary players, but that still shouldn’t take away from the
              importance of this monumental moment in sports. Kobe Bryant earned
              that coveted third spot on the all-time scoring list with
              those free-throws he sank against the Timberwolves in 2014.

              These two games were projected to be one of the toughest parts of
              the Los Angeles Lakers’ schedule. Back to back games against the
              two other teams who many have pegged as favorites to hoist the
              Larry O’Brien trophy.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the game against the Milwaukee Bucks led by the reigning MVP
              Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Lakers were firmly in the driver’s seat
              for the entirety of the game, and a late-game spin-move into a
              thunderous jam by LeBron James put the game on ice for good.
              LeBron ended up with a cool 37/8/8, and AD chipped in with 30
              points and 9 rebounds.
              <br />
              <br />
              After losses against the Clippers on opening night and Christmas
              day, the team was eager to prove their status as a true
              championship contender. LeBron James made a 3-point play with 40
              seconds left to put the game away for good. The team’s chemistry
              was at an all-time high.

          On Jan 26th 2020, Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna died in a
          helicopter crash.

          It was a great loss to the Lakers, the NBA league and the whole world,

            The regular season was accidentally interrupted by Covid-19. When
            the season resumed, doubts rose on whether the Lakers could keep a
            good condition during the playoffs, considering their high average
            age.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            Avery Bradley, who was the main defensive player in the team,
            decided not to play. In addition, the whole series would be carried
            out in “the Bubble”.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            Apart from the competitions, the team would also have to overcome
            other kinds of obstacles, for example, the loneliness by separating
            from family for long time.
